# CS4389_BankingProject
Banking app project for CS 4389, by Andres Flores, Davy Romine, Dev Vijay, and Uday Vasepalli

### Overview
Our app simulates a banking app, allowing the user to create an account, as well as deposit/withdraw money from their balance. We aimed to utilize hashing to conceal the userâ€™s account information and automatic time-out to protect the user from invalid account access. Our banking app serves as a rudimentary example of security patterns that should be followed for any app that aims to ensure confidentiality, availability, and integrity.
